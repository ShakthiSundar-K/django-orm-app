## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:

An Django application is created inside dataproject folder.
### STEP 2:

A python program is written to create a table to store and retrieve data.
### STEP 3:

The table is created with 5 fields in which the username field is made as PrimaryKey.
### STEP 4:

Then the project files migrated. A superuser is also created.
### STEP 5:

Now the server side program is executed .
### STEP 6:

The admin page of our website is accessed using username and password.
### STEP 7:

Records are added and saved in the table inside the database.
## PROGRAM

``` py
Model.py

from django.db import models
from django.contrib import admin
# Create your models here.


class Student (models.Model):
    Refno=models.CharField(primary_key=True,max_length=10,help_text='Refno')
    Sname=models.CharField(max_length=50)
    department=models.CharField(max_length=20)
